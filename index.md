### CPSC 120
* Lab 3

Lab 7, part 2  I found this lab very interesting and liked the way that we implemented algorithms for the first time. This lab really made me excited because it dealt with numbers and helped me understand the operations we use for c++.

Lab 5

Lab 5, part 2 This was my second favorite lab, this lab had us deal with For-loops and that was intriguing at first. We had to calculate square roots with For-loops which made it different.

Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 This was my third favorite lab, this lab was challenging at first because it involved using pi and the diameter of a pizza. The code calculated how many dollars a customer would have to pay per ounce.
